# About the Project
This project visualization is an interactive map.

The project is trying to display where National Parks are located in the US. 
It is trying to solve the isssue of people looking for information about which National Parks are in their state.
Also for people in the State of Maryland, it will show them information about all parks in the state of Maryland which are all linked. 
I want to specifically answer which national and state parks are found in which states? Which are the top 5 most visited 
national parks? 

I did not use any CSS frameworks. I downloaded Bulma but did not figure out how to use it.
