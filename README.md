# Which API?
I used the National Park Services API found here: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm

This project visualization is an interactive map.

The project is trying to display where National Parks are located in the US. 
It is trying to solve the isssue of people looking for information about which National Parks are in their state.
Also for people in the State of Maryland, it will show them information about all Parks in the state of Maryland.
